	These settings are intended for scripting and can contain a Preset 
	Configuration block.  If this block exists then "internal" settings are
	ignored and an external configuration file should be read instead, 
	e.g. PlayStation Portable profile.  However, if the external file is 
	missing, internal settings have to be used and will reflect a snapshot
	of the external configuration file at the time the script was generated.
